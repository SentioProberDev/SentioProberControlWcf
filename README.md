# Prerequisites
The Minimum required SENTIO version is 3.5. The SENTIO WCF Server must be active. This is normally the case. In order to check whether SENTIO will start its WCF service go to the WCFServer node in the Main node.

```xml
  <Main>
    ...
    <WcfServer Uri="net.tcp://localhost:35556/Sentio" />
    ...
```
